# Binary Search
(least usaco inspired problem in this ctf)
- Connect to the remote server given
- For this challenge, it is wise to read up on the way that binary search works: [a usaco guide link, which includes other helpful links](https://usaco.guide/silver/binary-search)
    - For instance, if the guess is between 1 and 1000, guess 500. If the number is between 500 and 1000 (aka higher than 500), guess 750. Procede like this until you get the final number
- The flag will then be printed, and your solution will be found
